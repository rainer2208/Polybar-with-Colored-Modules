# Polybar-with-Colored-Modules

We are never completely happy, are we? 

This a polybar with colored modules i made for leftwm.

Came out smooth,I guess. The update button opens urxvt terminal with the update command alreay inside.

Many connfigs are from the ArcoLinux Leftwm iso. Most grateful to Eric Dubois, for his unvaluable inspirations. And, of course, the entire, ArcoLinux and Linux community.
